Hi! I am a research engineer at [Center for Frontier AI Research (CFAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar) at A*STAR Singapore in [Dr. Cheston Tan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/dr-cheston-tan)'s Team working on exaplinable AI. I frequently collaborate with [Dr. Basura Fernando](https://basurafernando.github.io/) and [Prof. Gemma Roig](http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de).

Bio
---
I graduated from BITS Pilani with B.Engg. in Computer Science and (Integrated) M.Sc. in Biological Sciences in 2022. 
During my undergraduate degree, I worked on bioinformatics, formal language modeling, algorithms and deep learning. 
The exploration spree ultimately settled at deep learning, where I am interested in black-box understanding and explainability to ameliorate biases and improve trustworthiness.
Hence, I spent a wonderful semester in  Germany working with [Prof. Gemma Roig](http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de) and [Prof. Radek Cichy](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/rmcichy/) working on video reconstruction as a part of my thesis.
At A*STAR, I am working on interpreting and benchmarking the pitfalls of VideoQA transformer models.

For more details, refer to my CV.
